# HELLO RECRUITERS

### This is a project I made during my time at the Flatiron School. It allows users to browse, create, and "purchase" candles with a variety of scents!

### I'm particularly proud of the "custom candle" screen. I worked hard on this feature, and it taught me how to dynamically create instances in the backend, and have my React code communicate with Ruby through the use of JSON objects. 

## To see this code, please check out: 

### `client/src/components/CandleCreator.js`
#



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install --prefix client`

then

### `npm start --prefix client`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In a new terminal, execute the following code to run the backend servers

### `cd backend`

then

### `bundle install`

then

### `rake db:migrate`
### `rake db:seed`
### `rake server`
